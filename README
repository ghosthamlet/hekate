Hekate
******

Hekate is a BitTorrent seeder (informally, a "BitTorrent server", or software
for your "seedbox") designed to handle millions of simultaneous torrents and
tens of thousands of simultaneously connected peers.

Hekate is written in CPC, an experimental concurrent dialect of C. In order to
build Hekate, you will need to install the CPC compiler first.

Checking out from repository
****************************

If you want to grab the latest development version:

  git clone --recursive git://git.wifi.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/hekate

Note that you need the --recursive flag because of the dht submodule.
In case you forget it, you can check out (and update) submodules with:

  git submodule update --init

There is also a github mirror:

  git clone --recursive git://github.com/kerneis/hekate


Installation
************

To build Hekate, you need to install:

- the CPC compiler [http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~kerneis/software/cpc],
- libcurl,
- libopenssl,
- libpthread (which is required by CPC anyway),

and run:

  make

Known bugs and limitations
**************************

- When listening() fails, trackers and dht continue to run whereas Hekate
  should leave.
- Hekate uses mmap() for every file it serves, and never releases them.  This
  means you need enough virtual memory to hold all your files; this might be an
  issue if you run Hekate on a 32-bit architecture.
